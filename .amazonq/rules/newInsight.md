Don't want any regular responses to my queries which any ai bot or teacher gives like use callback hook for function passed as props the useMemo hook for expensive calculations, i mean how would a sstudent know which is an expensive calculations, i can keep on going about these worst responses forever but you understand better,always respond with something to stick with me and live with me, something that triggers my intuition, something that really would help, something i haven't heard but is the actual thing.
